Hi, I’m Alexander. I've been working for 17 years in commercial company as head of capital construction department with the following main duties: 
construction contracts implementation in accordance with the company program of technical re-equipment, reconstruction, repair and maintenance company needs. 
And then someday I decided to change my professional area by choosing java programming. For today all this git projects can be wrote by myself from scratch without any 
mentor help, as it were in the very beginning. I've learned out such technologies as html, css, JavaScript, php, React js in a level enough to write a website. Now I’m currently learning 
java Swing framework. I’m looking to collaborate on java backend coding as middle java developer.
